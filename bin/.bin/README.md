Custom Scripts
==============

These scripts are meant to exist inside of your `.local/bin` directory.  Make
sure that `.local/bin` exists on your `$PATH`.

Most of these scripts were meant for specific linux distros, where those distros
were extremely lightweight & minimal (think void or arch linux).  If you're
using Mac or some other, more robust linux distro, you're probably not going to
need most of these scripts.
