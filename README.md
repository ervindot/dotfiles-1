# Dotfiles

My personal dotfiles.  Dotfiles are simply configuration files that personalize
your system.  These configs are responsible for the personalization of your
system.  This
repo contains my very own dotfiles.  Feel free to use anything here.

**Note**:  As of now, the master installation file does not install everything
you need if you want to get up and running with my full setup.


## Install

To install with Git:

```
    git clone https://github.com/vinnyA3/dotfiles.git ~/.dotfiles
    source ~/.dotfiles/install.sh
```

## Additional Resources

* Get started with your own dotfiles 

    Lars Kappart has a fantastic [article](https://medium.com/@webprolific/getting-started-with-dotfiles-43c3602fd789) on dotfiles and how to get them set up. I
    used some of Lar's setup scripts to help with some
    scaffolding.
