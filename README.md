# Dotfiles

My personal dotfiles.  Dotfiles are simply configuration files that personalize
your system.  These configs are responsible for the personalization of your
system.  This
repo contains my very own dotfiles.  Feel free to use anything here.

**Note**: As of now, the master installation file does not install everything
you need if you want to install + run my setup.


## Install

To install with Git:

```
    git clone https://github.com/vinnyA3/dotfiles.git ~/.dotfiles
    source ~/.dotfiles/install.sh
```

    *Lars Kappert's [dotfiles](https://github.com/webpro/dotfiles)

    Lars has a fantastic [article](https://medium.com/@webprolific/getting-started-with-dotfiles-43c3602fd789) on dotfiles and how to get them set up. I
    used some of Lar's setup / scaffolding scripts to help with some
    scaffolding.
