# Dotfiles

My personal dotfiles.  Dotfiles are simply configuration files that personalize
your system.  These configs are responsible for the personalization of your
system.  This
repo contains my very own dotfiles.  Feel free to use anything here.

Currently, I'm using [pywal](https://github.com/dylanaraps/pywal) to generate a color palette based off of whatever
wallpaper I have loaded.

**Note**:  As of now, the master installation file does not install everything
you need, that is if you want to get up and running with my full setup without
hassle.


## Install

To install with Git:

```
    git clone https://github.com/vinnyA3/dotfiles.git ~/.dotfiles
    source ~/.dotfiles/install.sh
```

* Get started with your own dotfiles 

    Lars Kappart has a fantastic [article](https://medium.com/@webprolific/getting-started-with-dotfiles-43c3602fd789) on dotfiles and how to get them set up. I
    used some of Lar's setup scripts to help with some
    scaffolding.
