# Dotfiles

Dotfiles are configuration files that are used to customize and personalize
your system.  The *dotfiles* name comes from the UNIX convention of prefixing
config files with a dot. By default, these files are usually hidden in directory
listings.
This repo contains my very own dotfiles.  Feel free to use anything and
everything.

hassle.

    Lars Kappart has a fantastic [article](https://medium.com/@webprolific/getting-started-with-dotfiles-43c3602fd789) on dotfiles and how to get them set up. I
    used some of Lar's setup scripts to help with some
    scaffolding.
