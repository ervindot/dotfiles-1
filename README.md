# Dotfiles

Dotfiles are configuration files that are used to customize and personalize
your system.  The *dotfiles* name comes from the UNIX convention of prefixing
config files with a dot. By default, these files are usually hidden in directory
listings.
This repo contains my very own dotfiles.  Feel free to use anything and
everything.


## Sys Overview

* os: Arch Linux
* window manager:  Xmonad

## Install

To install with Git:

```
    git clone https://github.com/vinnyA3/dotfiles.git ~/.dotfiles
    source ~/.dotfiles/install.sh

**Warning**:  As of now, the master installation file does not install everything
you need, that is, if you want to get up and running without any hassle.

## Additional Resources

* Get started with your own dotfiles 

    Lars Kappart has a fantastic [article](https://medium.com/@webprolific/getting-started-with-dotfiles-43c3602fd789) on dotfiles and how to get them set up. I
    used some of Lar's setup scripts to help with some
    scaffolding.
