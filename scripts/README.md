:trollface: Scripts
=======

Here, you'll find some helpful & miscellaneous custom scripts.  Most were
intended for specfic linux-based distros (void linux, arch linux); however, some
are portable ie. `ytp`.

Unlike most things that were sourced by the [installer](), these are moved
manually; so, you pretty much have the freedom to move what you want where you
want.  My personal preference is to keep them inside my `$HOME/.local/bin`
directory.
