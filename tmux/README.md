TMUX Configuration
==================

Default prefix: `CTRL + a`

To get fully setup with this configuration, you're going to need to install
[TPM - Tmux Plugin Manager](https://github.com/tmux-plugins/tpm):

`git clone https://github.com/tmux-plugins/tpm ~/.tmux/plugins/tpm`

Once you have that installed, source your `tmux.conf` file (you can use:
`CTRL<Prefix> + r`) and install plugins with: `CTRL<prefix> + I`.

:sunglasses: You're ready to rock!
